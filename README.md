Goal:

- Provide people a way to enjoy life through scenic driving.
    - Basically the journey vs the destination

General Approach:

- Create an app with two features: Explore and Navigate.
    - Explore
        
         Get a tour of the city of elsewhere. Start and end destination is your current location so it’s basically an auto-guided tour.
        
    - Navigate
        
        

Questions:

- Will this app actually be useful to people?
- How do we want to structure this app? (Should we consider other options instead of the Explore/Navigate method?)
- Is everyone really committed to this project, or is it "just for college applications"? (This project will fail if it's built on building self-worth).
- 

3 Major Steps:

- Explore: Create an algorithm for ranking/enumerating scenic locations (museums, forests, state parks etc)
- Navigate: Create a model that maps the Bay Area urban landscape (residential district, urban areas, parks, lakes, etc)
    - Data needs to be scraped from "zone maps" of cities
- Create a working navigation system of routes (nothing novel but still needs to be implemented)
    - Book on navigation algorithms: “ Route Planning Algorithm for Car Navigation" by Flinsenberg, Ingrid C.M.

    - Put everything together to create a “scenic route”  that gets you to your destination by a certain time but still gives you a nice route.
    - Also apply the ranking system to create a city explorer with no final destination

## If we have time
- Implement the above algorithms into an app (iOS, android etc)
